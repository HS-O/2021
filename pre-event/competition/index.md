# Competition Series

The BuildingBloCS 2020 competition series aims to promote awareness and appreciation of how Computing is connected to our daily lives and the world around us. It will be a secular series of competitions with the objective of connecting festivities to Computing.

## What can I submit?

Anything educational you feel appropriate to represent and showcase your idea. It can be a simple code segment that displays some ASCII art related to the festival or some app with interesting q&a about the event. Any suitable tech related entry not limited to code (eg graphics and other media) will be accepted. *Bonus credit will be awarded for code submissions.* For cybersecurity reasons we will only accept code submissions in plain source code (eg link to GitHub Gist / Colab file / etc.) and not binary executables.

## Duh got connection meh?

The most creative Computing entries will win Grab food vouchers (you can use it to get your whatever fix). *There is no limit to the number of entries you can submit.* Entries can be **individual or team** but each entry is only eligible for 1 prize (we dun want people to piggyback on othersâ€™ effort).
