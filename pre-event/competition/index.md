# Competition Series

The BuildingBloCS 2020 competition series aims to promote awareness and appreciation of how Computing is connected to our daily lives and the world around us. It will be a secular series of competitions with the objective of connecting festivities to Computing.

## What can I submit?

Anything educational you feel appropriate to represent and showcase your idea. It can be a simple code segment that displays some ASCII art related to the festival or some app with interesting q&a about the event. Any suitable tech related entry not limited to code (eg graphics and other media) will be accepted. *Bonus credit will be awarded for code submissions.* For cybersecurity reasons we will only accept code submissions in plain source code (eg link to GitHub Gist / Colab file / etc.) and not binary executables.

## Duh got connection meh?

The most creative Computing entries will win Grab food vouchers (you can use it to get your whatever fix). *There is no limit to the number of entries you can submit.* Entries can be **individual or team** but each entry is only eligible for 1 prize (we dun want people to piggyback on othersâ€™ effort).


## Competition Details

<summary><strong>Hari Raya Puasa Edition (Completed)</strong></summary><br>

Congrats to <strong>Ms Ong Hui Qi Emily</strong> of Dunman High School for being the winner of BuildingBloCS 2020 mini-competition series - Hari Raya Puasa Edition!<br><br>

The sketch was made using https://github.com/EmilyOng/Sketch, which was done by Ms Ong. During the festival, due to the circuit breaker measures, it is hard for people to get together and celebrate. Sending text messages, emails or phone calls are appropriate ways to socialise, but may not be as heartfelt as everything is transmitted digitally using text. One way is for people to be able to send drawings to one another, making digital hand-drawn postcards, which can be done using the website above.<br><br>

Ms Ong has won for herself a Grabfood voucher.
